Description
This Python code offers an interactive way to create stories by filling in missing words within a text template. It's ideal for generating personalized stories, creating quizzes, or prompting creative writing exercises.

How it Works
Reads a story template: The code starts by reading a text file named "story.txt", which contains the story template with missing words enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <adjective>).
Identifies missing words: It scans the text, finds words within angle brackets, and stores them in a set.
Prompts for user input: For each missing word, the code prompts the user to provide a replacement word.
Fills in the blanks: The code substitutes the missing words in the story template with the user-provided words.
Prints the completed story: The final, personalized story is printed to the console.
Usage
Save the code as a Python file (e.g., story_generator.py).
Create a text file named "story.txt" with the story template.
Run the code from the command line: python story_generator.py
Follow the prompts to provide replacement words.
Enjoy the completed story!
